# Felitrix

Howdy, I'm a young person in Front-end programming with the principles of making the Internet a healthier place, open and accessible to anyone.

I'm a Mozilla contributor as part of the Social Support Contributor and also working in the Mozilla Support (SUMO) community with the intention of taking the knowledge I've acquired to everyone who needs help.

I also work on Fedora project as L10N translator to make Linux more accessible to Brazilians.
